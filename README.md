# SecureBPMN

[SecureBPMN](https://www.brucker.ch/projects/securebpmn/index.en.html)
is a domain-specific modeling language that allows to model security
aspects (e.g., access control, separation of duty,
confidentiality). SecurePBPMN is defined as a meta-model that can
easily be integrated into BPMN and, thus, can be used for modeling
secure and business processes as well as secure service compositions.

The SecureBPMN tool chain does not only support modeling of secure business 
process and service compositions: it also supports the formal analysis both 
on the level of SecureBPMN models as well as refinement properties between 
the model and the actual implementation. 

## Installation

### SecureBPMN Designer

#### Prerequisites

* Eclipse Helios
* SATMC (http://www.ai-lab.it/satmc/), version 3.3.x
  (for the formal analysis of secure business processes)

#### Preparing the Eclipse environment

First, install the GenericBreakGlass-XACML into your local 
maven repository:
```
cd GenericBreakGlass-XACML/src/eu.aniketos.securebpmn.xacml.parent
mvn clean eclipse:clean 
mvn eclipse:eclipse 
mvn install 
cd ..
```

To initialize the Eclipse project structure, please do 
```
cd designer/src//org.activiti.designer.parent
mvn clean eclipse:clean 
mvn eclipse:eclipse
cd ..
```

After this, all projects can be imported into a fresh Eclipse
workspace using `File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace`.

#### Generate Model Classes

1. Open the folder `model` in the project `org.activiti.designer.model`
2. Open `BPMN20.genmodel`
3. Select the top level node (`bpmn2`)
4. Select `Generator -> Reload...` from the top-level menu, select
   `Ecore model` and complete the wizard. While doing this, ensure
   that all packages are select in the `Package Selection` screen.
5. Select the top level node (`bpmn2`)
6. Select `Generator -> Generate all` from the top-level menu

#### Start Eclipse Application

Select the project `org.activiti.designer.eclipse` and select `Run as
-> Eclipse application` in the context menu (right click).

### SecureBPMN Runtime

#### Prerequisites

Java 6 must be installed and executable:
```
export JAVA_HOME=<install directory of java 6>
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
Moreover, the xalan libraries must be installed:
```
cd runtime/src/userguide 
ant install.xalan.libs
```

### Building the SecureBPMN Runtime

If you did not install GenericBreakGlass-XACML into your local 
maven repository as part of the installation of the SecureBPMN 
Designer:
```
cd GenericBreakGlass-XACML/src/eu.aniketos.securebpmn.xacml.parent
mvn clean eclipse:clean 
mvn eclipse:eclipse 
mvn install 
cd ..
```

Compile the SecureBPMN runtime:
```
cd runtime/src/distro
ant clean distro 
```

If ``ant `clean distro``` is not able to download tomcat, please 
download `apache-tomcat-6.0.32.zip` and copy it into 
`runtime/src/distro/target`.

### Executing the SecureBPMN Runtime

```
cd runtime/src/distro/target/activiti-5.8/setup/
ant demo.start 
```

And open `http://localhost:8080/activiti-explorer` in a web browser. 
Note that `and demo.stop` will stop the demo and `ant demo.clean` will 
reset the demo setup.
